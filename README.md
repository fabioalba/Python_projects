# Python_projects

In this repository I collect some of the final projects from App Brewery course "100 days of Code - The complete Python Pro Bootcamp". In the course no guidance is provided, just general instruction of what the project should do (or replicate): solutions and coding style, with their upsides and flaws, are mine. 

Here there are some legendary games from the 80s, Space Invaders and Breakout (using just Turtle package for the graphics), a more classic Tic Tac Toe using Numpy, and a Morse-Code string converter.

Classes and functions are used as much as possible in these projects, keeping them separated from main.py to make the project as readable as possible; have fun!
